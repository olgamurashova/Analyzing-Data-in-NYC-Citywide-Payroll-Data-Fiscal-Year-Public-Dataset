## Analyzing Data in Citywide Payroll Data Fiscal Year Public Dataset

### Project overview

In this project, I analyzed public NYC Payroll Data available at [here](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/Citywide-Payroll-Data-Fiscal-Year-/k397-673e). 
To be able to manipulate the dataset, I had to import the dataset table using PostgreSQL tool called pgAdmin. 


1. Calculating average base salary across all agencies and boroughs in 2020:
